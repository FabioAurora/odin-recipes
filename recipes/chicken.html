    <p>
      An easy, one-pan dinner that's fairly hands-off once everything's in the
      oven. Make sure to chop your veggies into even pieces, or they won't cook
      properly.
    </p>

    <h3>step 1</h3>
    <p>
      Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a rimmed
      baking sheet.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>
      Place potatoes, onion, carrots, and radishes in a large bowl. Drizzle with
      oil, and toss to coat. Sprinkle with 1 teaspoon dill, 1/2 teaspoon kosher
      salt, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Toss again to coat. Pour veggies out
      onto the prepared baking sheet.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>
      While the veggies bake, prepare the chicken. In the same bowl the veggies
      were in, add the Greek yogurt, lemon zest, lemon juice, 1 teaspoon dill,
      1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, onion powder, garlic powder, and 1/4 teaspoon
      black pepper. Mix until thoroughly combined. Dip each chicken thigh into
      the yogurt mixture, making sure each one is evenly coated.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 5</h3>
    <p>
      Remove pan from the oven, and gently push the veggies to the sides of the
      pan, leaving room in the middle for the chicken thighs. Place the thighs
      in the middle of the baking sheet, and place pan back into the oven until
      chicken is no longer pink in the center, and veggies are tender, 30 to 40
      minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of each
      thigh should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). If desired, place
      pan beneath broiler, and broil chicken for a few minutes to brown the
      chicken. Season with additional salt and pepper to taste before serving.
